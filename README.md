Web Based App allowing one to hail a mathree

## introduction

Mathrees are Nairobi's public transport system. The term refers to vehicles (mostly mini-buses, can include passenger vans) that travel along fixed routes into and out of the city making stops at designated areas along the route.

They have an informal history and and still operate very much in that manner even as local goverment has increasingly imposed formality into the industry. 

For instance, they may follow a designated route but when and for how long they will stay at a stop is determined by the crew using their best judgement (and whatever is must lucrative for them). As you can probably guess, they rarely consider the passengers when making these descisions.

This prototype app is meant to work along the whole spectrum from the most informal up to BRT level systems by allowing the most basic concepts to be defined and specialisation only introduced when needed.
