# mathree-hailer

Web Based App allowing one to hail a mathree

## introduction

Mathrees are Nairobi's public transport system. They refer to mini-buses tht travel along fixed routes into and out of the city amking stops at designated areas.

They have an informal history and and still operate very much in that manner even as local goverment has increasingly imposed formality into the industry. 

This prototype app is meant to work along the whole spectrum from the most informal up to BRT level systems by allowing the most basic concepts to be defined and specialisation only introduced when needed.
